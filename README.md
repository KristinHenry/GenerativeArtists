# GenerativeArtists

I've recently been pointed to this fantastic article, and am reflecting on how to make changes: https://medium.com/@quinncrossley/uplifting-diverse-genders-beyond-women-and-non-binary-916c890f2185



On Dec 9, 2018 I was a little fed up with yet another list of Generative Artists completely devoid of any women. I tweeted 
	
> "Lists of Generative Artists that leave out women are just too cliche. Who are your favorite Generative Artists and Creative Coders, who are also women? Let's start a list."

The responses were wonderful! I discovered so many amazing artists, that I hadn't already known about. Also, I shared some of my favorites.

The list below is the initial result of this crowdsourced celebration of women in Generative Art. My hope is that it will continue to grow.

### Note: this is a temporary location, and a preliminary list. A long-term solution is in the works. If you know of someone who should be added to this list, please reach out. https://vis.social/@kristinHenry

## This is a list of Generative Artists who are also Women or Nonbinary
In case clarification is needed, Trans Women ARE Women.
